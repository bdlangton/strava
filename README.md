# strava
Strava app built with Silex.

# about
When a user approves this app to access their Strava data, then it can pull in
data and display that data in interesting ways. Strava is a great product, but
it isn't great at reporting on data that it has. That is the gap that this app
is intending to fix. Currently, you can view individual activities, personal
records, and course records. You can also view graphs of data broken up by
activity type and date range, and also group it monthly, weekly, or yearly.
